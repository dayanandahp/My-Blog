Blog web application

The goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view blog posts. Posts will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application. Styling will be an important aspect of this project to ensure a good user experience.

Installation
For this project, here’s what you’ll need to install:

Node.js: Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already, as it provides the runtime for executing JavaScript server-side.

Express.js: To install Express, use the command:

npm install express

EJS: EJS is the templating engine, which you can install with: npm install ejs

Nodemon (Optional): Useful for automatic server restarts during development. Install it globally with:

npm install -g nodemon

Create the Project Structure: Initialize your Node.js project and set up basic files:

mkdir blog-app cd blog-app npm init -y

Basic Structure Setup: Make sure your project has the following folder structure: 
blog-app/ 
├── views/ 
│ └── index.ejs 
│ └── edit.ejs 
│ └── new.ejs 
├── public/ 
│ └── edit.css 
│ └── index.css 
│ └── new.css
├── app.js
└── package.json

Tech Stack
This project uses the following technologies:

Node.js
JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development. Handles server setup and application logic. 2. Express.js Framework for Node.js, simplifying server and routing setup. Manages middleware, routing, and handles HTTP requests and responses. 3. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) Templating engine that allows JavaScript logic within HTML templates. Used for dynamic content rendering based on application state. 4. HTML & CSS HTML for structuring the web pages. CSS for styling the application, ensuring responsive and visually pleasing UI on various devices. 5. JavaScript (Frontend) Adds interactivity to the UI, enhancing user experience.

Roadmap
Roadmap for Blog Web Application

Planning (0-1 Hour)
Define app functionality and design concepts. Create initial wireframes for the main pages. Determine necessary routes and pages. 2. Setup (1 Hour)

Initialize the Node.js project and install dependencies (Express.js, EJS). Set up project structure: routes, views, and static files. Create the Express.js server and basic routing. 3. Feature Implementation (2-3 Hours)

Post Creation: Develop a form for new posts on the home page and handle form submissions. Post Viewing: Code the display of all posts on the home page. Post Editing/Deleting: Enable editing and deleting posts directly from the home page. Testing: Verify that post creation, viewing, and deletion are functioning as expected. 4. Styling and Responsiveness (4-5 Hours)

Create a CSS file for the application. Style EJS templates to ensure responsive design using CSS, Bootstrap, or Flexbox/Grid. Test across devices/browsers and fix any design or functionality issues.

Lessons Learned
What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

While building this blog web application, you likely learned about how Node.js and Express.js manage server-side logic and routes, as well as how EJS templates enable dynamic HTML rendering based on application data. This project may have also given you hands-on experience with organizing code into different views and routes, working with forms, and handling user actions like creating, editing, and deleting posts.

Challenges could have included managing user inputs effectively and designing a structure that makes it easy to add, update, or delete posts without using a database. Additionally, styling the application to be both desktop- and mobile-responsive may have required experimenting with CSS or frameworks like Bootstrap. Overcoming these might have involved testing, refining the user experience, and learning to handle routes and conditional rendering with EJS templates efficiently.
